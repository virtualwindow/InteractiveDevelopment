**Course overview**

The Interactive Development 101 course is a series of lectures introducing students to programming and interactive electronics in academic and practical assignments. The focus is on building the student's ability to solve problems logically and in a detailed enough way for machines to execute.

**Modular overview**

**Module 1: Introduction to Programming**

We start off teaching the student how to draw simple shapes to screen such as lines, circles and triangles. Then we progressively increase complexity developing a deep understanding of looped algorithms and data manipulation. The student will learn how to program complex ideas and generate beautiful patterns at the same time.

**Module 2: Interactive Programming**

We progress from the first module into interactivity keyboard, mouse and touch. We'll build a simple game or interactive application. We'll learn about storing and retrieving data from storage.

**Module 3: Introduction to Electronics**

We build simple electronic circuits and program microcontrollers to control robots that can sense and react to the environment.

**Module 4: Networked Interface Design for Interactive Robotics**

We learn how to design and build interfaces to ease interaction and control of electronics and robotics.

**Relevance to industry**

As mobile devices increase we are become a more digital society. Part of this progression is our understanding and command of all things digital. This means being able to not only craft digital data, but also use digital as a means to affect and measure the physical world. By learning how to combine electronics, art and code we unlock new means of solving problems.

**Relation to other subjects**

We have a strong focus on the technical aspects in this course that will have to be supported by more design or philosophical based classes to be of maximal use. As with all things, the more you know about everything, the better you understand how something fits into the whole.

**Relation to previous and following years**

The previous year we introduced much of this content as two electives in the Film Arts department as an augmentation of the gamedevelopment, allowing students to build their own game controllers and games.





**Module 1: Introduction to Programming**



**1.1    Module Overview**

Then we progressively increase complexity developing a deep understanding of looped algorithms and data manipulation. The student will learn how to program complex ideas and generate beautiful patterns at the same time.

**1.2    Module outcomes**

_On completion of the module students should be able to:_

- Demonstrate an understanding of programming conventions and design patterns in code. An understanding of fractal and procedural algorithms.

- Show a working knowledge of javascript, html, css.

**1.3    Assessment activities**

**1.3.1    Theoretical assignments**

The learners study the history of computing as well as look at various futurists work. They then need to convey their point of view on how the world can be improved by technology. This can take the form of an illustration or written piece.

**1.3.2    Practical assignments**

Learners create a programmatic looping digital artwork for web distribution. Heavy use of fractals and l-system like algorithms should be used and direct image use avoided. They should show an understanding of random number generation, utilizing 3D distance and angles, nearest neighbours, and visualising hierarchical data structures.
